# WeatherForecasting

- Developed to ilustrate the temperature and humidity of a room in time. Uses C++ to build an Arduino Sketch and Python to send the sensor data to ThingSpeak API.

- In the circuit there is a group of LED lights that will operate according to the temperature (ÂºC). They can have 3 light states - Red, Yellow or Green. This mecanism represents an alarm to inform the user that the sensor reach a certain temperature.
The alarm has 2 states, on/off controlled by a button.


- Final Project for Arquitecture and Computer Systems subject.
